### In this project, I have performed detailed exploratory data analysis for the two different datasets:
1. About COVID-19 outbreak in all USA counties
2. Gender classification of the babies born in the USA from 1880 and 2018

Let's talk about each dataset:

1. COVID-19 Dataset
- This data analysis is about COVID-19 for all of the counties of the United States.
- I have taken the data from the following source:
- [COVID-19 data Source for the United States](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)

2. Names Dataset
- This data analysis is all about predicting a sex of babies born in USA from 1880 to 2018.
- I have created two model to predict the sex
 1. One model is from-scratch model, which behaves like a machine-learning model
 2. Other is a Decisiontree model
